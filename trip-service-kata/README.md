#### Tasks
1. Focus on ```org.craftedsw.tripservicekata.trip.getTripsByUser```.
2. Familiarize yourself with the method - only a bit, not in deep.
3. Identify the **shortest branch**.
4. Write your first Unittest, that traverse this shortest branch.
    * Hint: To write this Unittest, you properly need to introduce seams.
5. Eventually use code coverage tool to verify that all bits of this branch is covered.
6. Explore other execution branches.

As soon as you do have a sufficient safety net in place:
* start exploring the intent of this code and 
* start refactoring.
